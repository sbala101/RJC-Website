<h2><center><b>Meet Hailey Godin (she/her), The President</b></center></h2>
<p>
As a rising Junior at California High School, Hailey Godin discovered her interest for social justice and her love of helping her community in a social justice and community English class her freshman year. With the help of her freshman English teacher, her friends and classmates, she helped create the Cal Restorative Justice Coalition over the summer prior to her sophomore year. Outside of school, she is a dedicated travel softball player who has played for over eight years and made varsity twice. She likes to spend her free time outside, with friends and listening to music. With only two years left at Cal, Hailey hopes to make a positive difference in the community, set up Cal RJC for success following her graduation, and spark a similar change in other schools throughout the SRVUSD school district.
